# numbertowrittenstring

My version of the "number to written string and back" functions. To run the functions, simply do the following:

1. Open the index.js and enter your language, written string and number at the top of the file.
2. Run the file within your IDE or run ```node index.js``` in the root directory.

millions and billions will also work!

-- For now the string-to-number function is not finished yet. --
